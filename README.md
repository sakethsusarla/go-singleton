## Singleton Example - Sheldon's Immutable Living Preferences

### Prologue
Life at 2311 North Robles Avenue is never simple, especially when Sheldon Cooper's "predictable perfection" faces even a hint of disturbance. After a particularly heated argument about thermostat settings, furniture arrangement, and meal selection, Leonard decided to codify Sheldon's living preferences into a system everyone could refer to.

### Problem
Leonard’s initial attempt was to let everyone maintain their own version of Sheldon's preferences. Unsurprisingly, this backfired:

1. *Sheldon*: _"Leonard! Your version of my preferences has introduced inconsistencies! My spot must face the optimal TV viewing angle. Penny’s copy says otherwise, which is frankly disturbing!"_
2. *Amy*: _"And somehow, Raj’s applet thinks Sheldon's favorite drink is a Mango Lassi. This is chaos, Leonard!"_
3. *Penny*: _"Whatever, guys. I’m just saying, I’m not going to remember which spaghetti recipe Sheldon likes when there’s 10 versions floating around!"_
The duplication of Sheldon's preferences was causing more arguments than it solved.

### Solution
Leonard suggested using the Singleton Design Pattern to enforce one immutable, globally accessible version of Sheldon's preferences. He declared:

1. _"We’ll create a SheldonConfiguration—a single, shared instance that encapsulates all of Sheldon’s living preferences. No duplicates, no misunderstandings."_
2. _"It will be thread-safe, so no matter how many people or devices access it simultaneously, the data remains consistent. Think of it as Sheldon's immutable living manifesto."_
3. _"The once synchronization mechanism will ensure that the preferences are initialized only once. Any further requests will just return the same instance. Efficient and Sheldon-approved!"_
